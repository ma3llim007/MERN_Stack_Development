What Is Objects ??
    An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method. Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life.

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.


    Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
    Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
